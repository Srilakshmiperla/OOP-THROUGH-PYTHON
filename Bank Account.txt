To stimulate basic operations such as depositing and withdrawing money. The key focus will be on creating a BankAccount class that allows users to : 
.Deposit money into their account
.Withdraw money from their account (Only if sufficient balance is avaliable)
.Display the current balance
 

class RBI:
     def __init__(self):
          self.balance = 0
          print("Welcome to the Reserve Bank of India")
     def deposit(self):
          amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit :"))
          self.balance += amount
          print("\n Deposited amount is :",amount )
     def withDraw(self):
          amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw : "))
          if self.balance >= amount:
               self.balance -= amount
               print("\n Withdrawn amount is : ",amount)
          else:
               print("\n Insufficient balance")
     def checkBalance(self):
          print("\n Current balance is : ",self.balance)
          
#Driver code
obj = RBI()
obj.deposit()
obj.withDraw()
obj.checkBalance()
